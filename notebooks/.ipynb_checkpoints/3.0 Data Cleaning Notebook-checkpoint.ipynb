Most of this work will be academic and mainly to explain how the raw data becomes the final data for the analysis (this cleaning does not necessarily need to be understood in order to understand the analysis)."

    "## Cleaning Basic Statistics Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Pass\n",
    "- **Removed Position Column**: This column was not necessary as all players were wide receivers\n",
    "- **Removed Fumbles Column**: As found in the EDA, these fumbles were very present for players playing special teams, so it was removed in order to isolate receiving talent.\n",
    "- **Altered Player Column**: This column needed to be edited to match the format of the advanced stats name column, as its format is less granular\n",
    "- **Altered Catch Rate Column**: Turned this column into a numeric column for analysis, and changed it from a percentage to a decimal representation and renamed it to **Catch Rate**\n",
    "- **Created a Rec Pts Column**: Created a column to account for receiver production based only on yards and touchdowns, modeled after fantasy football scoring; 6 points for a touchdown, 1 point for every 10 receiving yards\n",
    "- **Created a Rec Pts per Game Column**: Similarly to above, created a column for Rec Pts per Game. Due to the unpredictable nature of injuries, this column may be better suited for a target in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Pass\n",
    "- **Filled Null Position Entries**: Made a list of players that had ever played WR, and if they had a null entry for their position for a year, filled it with WR, as they most likely played receiver that year, just in a smaller or different role. (Made all entries capitalized as well)\n",
    "- **Altered Team Column**: Made team column the same format as the other data sets\n",
    "- **Created Stats Share Columns**: Made an entry for each player to show what percentage of each stat they had for their team (in terms of WR stats), in order to control for offensive output\n",
    "- **Created a Next Team Column**: Created a column for what team each player was on the next year, in order to calculate the stats leaving and entering the team next year to predict stats gained/lost. Used 2020 Free Agent data as scraped and uploaded in order to find 2020 roster changes.\n",
    "- **Created In/Out Stats Columns**: Created columns (**Projected [Stat]**) to show how big a share and how much of each stat a player is projected to have assuming they gain all the stats that players leaving had and lose stats that the players coming in had, given that the rest of their stats stay around the same\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: While it was considered whether or not certain 'per target' stats should have minimum target requirements on them, it was felt that this would greatly affect the data, as these entries would be disproportionately the first and second year players that are being investigated."
